# Open business decisions

These belong to named people, not to the development agent. Stage 0 has been
built so that each one lands cheaply when it is made; where a decision was
needed to make progress, the placeholder is marked as provisional in the code
and named here.

## Blocking or shaping Stage 1

| Decision | Owner | Why it matters now | Where it lands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Official CVI package, permitted web fonts, dark-mode interpretation | Communications/CVI | Every colour in `static/css/tokens.css` is a marked placeholder. Components must not be built on placeholders. | ADR 0009, one file |
| Final `Hetkeseis` vocabulary, help text, track applicability and closure mapping | Department head + lawyers | `StageVocabulary` and `LegacyStatusMapping` are empty; the dev seed uses provisional labels flagged `is_provisional`. The workbook's 11 authoritative labels must be transcribed from the live file, not reconstructed. | Reviewed data migration |
| Matter numbering and successor reference rules | Department head | `YYYY_N` is implemented as the default. Allocation is isolated in `allocate_matter_reference()`. | One function |
| Submission kinds, recipients, and what counts as a reportable written opinion | Department head + reporting owner | Drives `submission_sent_count` in the export contract and the Stage-1 Submission model. | ADR 0007 + Stage-1 schema |
| Initial PolicyArea list, controlled Tag seed, taxonomy owner | Department head + lawyers | Taxonomy tables ship empty on purpose; the dev seed uses only the tag concepts the specification itself names. | Reviewed data migration |
| DashKoda export format and consumer owner | DashKoda owner | The v1 contract is drafted and awaiting agreement. | `docs/data-contracts/dashkoda-export-v1.md` |

## Required before the Secure Pilot Gate

| Decision | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Restricted-content business roles and break-glass policy | Department head + privacy/security |
| Retention, legal hold, raw email and contact-person treatment | Privacy/legal |
| SharePoint working-document permission rules for restricted Matters | Department + IT/security |
| Production Azure subscription, resource ownership and billing | Management/IT |
| Internet-facing versus internal/VPN, and Conditional Access | IT/security |

## Later

| Decision | Owner | Needed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Submission/opinion approval and the role of juhatus | Department leadership | Before any structured approval feature |
| `Töövõit` threshold, evidence and approver | Management + communications/legal | Phase 2 |
| Independent backup destination and key custodians | Management/IT | Before production go-live |
| Support/absence cover and second administrator | Management | Before production go-live |
| Metric catalogue owner and coverage thresholds | Department head + reporting owner | Stage 4 |
| Whether multi-year objectives justify a PolicyThread UI | Department + pilot evidence | Phase 2 |

## Decisions taken by the development agent in Stage 0

Recorded so they can be challenged rather than inherited silently:

1. Python 3.13 + Django 5.2 LTS, `uv` for locking, `ruff` + `mypy` + `pytest`
   (ADR 0001).
2. UUIDv7 primary keys generated in Python; `display_reference` derived rather
   than stored (ADR 0002).
3. Child visibility is derived at query time and never stored, so no write path
   can leave a stale value that reads as less restrictive than the truth
   (ADR 0005).
4. Tailwind and HTMX deferred to Stage 1; Stage 0 ships plain CSS custom
   properties (ADR 0009).
5. `DocumentDerivative` and `SearchDocument` deferred to Stage 2, because both
   are rebuildable and their shape depends on models that do not exist yet
   (ADR 0003, ADR 0006).
6. A closed **archive** Matter is not required to carry a closure reason, so
   that the import never invents one. Closed **full** Matters are.
